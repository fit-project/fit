# FIT 2.X.X â€” End of Support Notice

The 2.X.X release line of **FIT (Freezing Internet Tool)** contains several known bugs and architectural limitations.  
For this reason, the project is now being **redesigned into a modular suite**, which will officially debut with **FIT 3.0.0**.

---

## Transition to FIT 3.0.0

Starting from version **3.0.0**, FIT will no longer be a single monolithic application,  
but a **modular suite** composed of several independent Python packages â€” each focused on a specific type of acquisition.

Each module can be installed and executed separately, or as part of the complete FIT suite.
